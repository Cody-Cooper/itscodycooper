                The Odin Project tasked me with creating a 16 by 16 grid of squares that change colors when the mouse hovers over them.
                Originally, I made a grid out of divs and containers. It worked, but I decided to go for something a little more
                interactive and let the user choose exactly how big they wanted their sketch area to be. I accomplished this by creating
                a javascript function that appends a container div to the sketch area's body. I added this step because the easiest way
                to clear the board is to just delete the entire parent container and then add a new, empty grid. To make the actual grid,
                I take the height value that the user enters and create that many unordered lists inside the container, and then take
                the width value and append that many list elements to the unordered list.
            </p>
            <p class="flow-text">
                My next challenge was making the squares change colors when the user hovered over them. I decided that I wanted to have
                each square change to a random color when the user hovered over them, so wrote a function that generates a random RGB
                color code. I then used that function to append CSS styles to the square when the user hovered over it. I also made a
                monochrome mode, where the square gets filled with a light gray color that gets darker each time the user hovers over it.

                Now I needed some kind of navigation for the user to change the grid's size, clear the board, or change their fill type.
                My goals were to keep it as simple and clutter free as I possibly could. I decided to use a minimalistic flex-box sidebar
                and color code the buttons. I used the same RGB color code function from the fill type to make the random color button
                change to a random color each time the user hovers it. The monochrome button changes from a light shade of gray to a darker
                shade of gray (no surprise there), and the new grid and clear buttons change to green and red, respectivly.

                I used a lot of technology I had never used before while making this small web application. I learned how to effectively use
                flex-box to acheive a desired layout, how to integrate javascript functionality in to a web page, how to append css attributes
                to an element using jQuery, and creating the RGB code generator helped cement my knowledge of javascript looping in place.
